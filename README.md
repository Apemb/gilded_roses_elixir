# gilded_roses_elixir
The Gilded Roses refactoring kata done in elixir

The dojo was copied from the elixir directory of [Emily Bache's gilded roses repo](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

This a solution I tried, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things to improuve, any feedback appreciated ðŸ¤—

## To launch the tests
Run the tests by running: `mix tests`

## To launch the linter
First you need the `credo` dependency. To get it do:
`mix deps.get`

Afterwards, to run the linter run:
`mix credo --strict`
